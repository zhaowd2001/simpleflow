Introduction:

AMicroBlogAPI is a C# implementation, a strong-typed deep encapsulation, a easy-to-use .net wrapper of SINA microblog APIs. 
App developers no longer need to parse various HTTP responses -- all responses are parsed into strong types;
No longer need to construt the request query strings -- just simply gives the values of parameters;
No longer need to implement the OAuth -- a single call could logs the user on.
